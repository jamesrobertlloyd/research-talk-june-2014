This component is assumed to continue to be approximately periodic.
The shape of the function is assumed to vary smoothly between periods but will return to the prior.
The prior is entirely uncertain about the phase of the periodic function.
Consequently the pointwise posterior will appear to lose its periodicity, but this merely reflects the uncertainty in the shape and phase of the function.
[This is a placeholder for a description of how quickly the posterior will start to resemble the prior].
